# GeoVisualization-Leaflet-Webmap
 This is a webmap built as part of the Ryerson Univeristy SA8905 Course

For this project, the qgis2web plugin from the opensource GIS software, QGIS, is used inorder to facilitate converting data into json format and alleviate the need for manual coding.

The code is changed slightly by changing the opacities of layers and highlight on the javascript code manually to match the legend of the map.
